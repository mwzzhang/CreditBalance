CreditBalance

"Kill your speed, not your credit balance"

Displays credit balance and rebuy in EDMC.

Wrote this because flipping through Ship Info Panel gets old really fast.

Alpha quality, no optimization currently whatsoever.

Future Plan:
* Display Combat related voucher balance (e.g. combat bond amount)
* Display Exploration related voucher balance (e.g. exobiology)
* Display loan (doubt my account will have one in the near future so can't test it)
* Display powerplay related credit voucher (if any. Don't actually do PowerPlay so can't test it either)
* Configuration for toggling information display off
